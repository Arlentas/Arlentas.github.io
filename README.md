Hey ya'll I finally decided to add a readme to this project. This is my blog where I post weekly updates on stuff I have been doing in college IT. It's built with the minimal mistakes jekyll theme (yeah the most popular non-default jekyll theme), but I have added some custom elements. Oh and dont mind me spamming the commit button occasionally - I should really start squashing them :)
