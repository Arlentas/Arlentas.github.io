Hi, my name is Morgan Potter. I am a year 12 student currently studying at Burgmann Anglican School. This blog contains weekly updates of my learning in college IT, and was created for an ongoing school project. You can find blog posts related to my school subjects in the blog section. You can find posts related to my projects under the projects page. If you would like to contact me, you can find my details to the left (assuming you are on a desktop). 

Although this blog is technically a school assessment piece, it has become my go-to platform to learn about, explain and rant about various IT / STEM concepts. I also use this blog to reflect on the week, and plan what to do next. I am very passionate about IT and related fields, so I hope you get a glimpse of my passion through these blog posts; you might even learn something.
