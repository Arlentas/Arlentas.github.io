This week I got the opportunity to begin tinkering with Arduinos. To learn the basics, I completed some simple projects created by DF robot. I completed 3 challenges - a simple blinking light, a light blinking SOS in moarse code and a simple traffic light simulation.

These challenges involved both coding and building the circuits. I consolidated my knowledge of breadboards, pWm pins, and learnt about resistance in circuits. The Arduino IDE is an adaptation of C++, and hence I learnt C++ functions, for loops and variable assignment. I enjoyed completing these projects, however they are very repetitive, and adding the hardware element takes more time than solely coding, additionally each circuit must be dissasembled when complete. I need to be more patient to learn Arduinos, it is more challenging than Grok. The only circuits I coded where the blinking light (which I have lost), and the SOS blinking light. You can find the SOS code below, I tried to optimize it using OOP. 

{% highlight C++ %}
int ledPin = 10;
  
void setup() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  pinMode(10, OUTPUT);
}

void dot() {
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  delay(150);
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  delay(100);
}
void dash () {
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  delay(400);
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  delay(100);
}

void loop() {
  for (int i=0; i < 3; i++) {
    dot();
  }
  for (int i=0; i < 3; i++) {
    dash();
  }
  for (int i=0; i < 3; i++) {
    dot();
  }
    delay(2000);
}
