This week in data science I completed the third MatPlotLib task, about graph customization. This task detailed how to change features on graphs such as colour, markers, line styles and many other plot attributes. Using the knowledge I gained in the task, I was able to complete the associated exercises. 

Changing plot attributes is inherently easy, most simply requiring a plot function argument. Some attributes are more difficult than others. Changing attributes becomes confusing when you want to make each line, and each set of markers have different colours. I had to search this up whilst doing one of the exercises - you have to edit the markerfacecolor attribute, which was not covered in the document. Other than that slight setback, the whole task was rather easy, how hard can editing colors be?

There were three exercises across the whole document, two of which only required me to mess around with the colours. The only somewhat-difficult exercise was the final one, which made me have to use google again. I had to find how to edit marker borders, which was through the attribute markeredgecolor, and I had to use the previously discussed markerfacecolor. I am not sure if this was the intended way of completing the task, as these attributes were not discussed in the task, but I learnt how to edit them anyway. My submission is below.

Learning these will be very important in my Data Science assignment, as I have to display the data in a good way. I still have to further look at the task sheet, but it looks like an enjoyable task. I will need to know how to use MatPlotLib properly, so that I can implement any visualisation necessary. 

This week I also continued developing my Burgmann APA Referencing website. I did not get much time to work on this because of assessment, but using the time I had, I was able to change the subheader contents to links instead of buttons, and was able to create the new reference page. I also figured out that cookies are a rather dumb way to store data when local storage exists. I did not do much, but the website is going to get there slowly but surely.
