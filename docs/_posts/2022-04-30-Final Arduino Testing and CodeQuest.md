This week I finished the example arduino projects, and competed in Lockheed Martin Codequest. The arduino projects was something I had been behind on for a long time, as I had been spending my time creating my own projects. I was able to smash out 3 example projects in one lesson, as I copied the code for them from the project guide. This helped me to get the projects done but did not help me to learn C++. Doing a project on my own requires me to write the code for it, which is much more beneficial for my overall learning. These projects had to get done before my assignment though, so it was good getting them done so quickly. None of the circuitry was too hard to set up with a guide, 2/3 projects are below.

Codequest is a coding competition run by Lockheed Martin in which around 30 teams from across Australia and Singapore are given scored coding problems. The team with the most points at the end wins. My team comprised of 2/3 possible slots, and we placed around 11th overall. I scored 65/80 of the teams points, which is about a third of the top teams points. It is nice to know I would have pulled my weight in some of the top teams. I am however a bit sad I did not get more points, as I got stuck searching how to convert binary to ascii characters in python. The rest of the question requiring the conversion took me around 30 minutes, and if I didn't get stuck I could have had around an hour more to do more questions. This could have a 40-60 point loss, which is quite frustrating, especially when finishing within 10 points of the year 12 team.
