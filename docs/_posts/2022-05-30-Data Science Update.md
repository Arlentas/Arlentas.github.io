This week I did not complete much work in Data Science. Most of my time during the lessons was spent doing robotics, which I have nearly finished. To reflect, I do not think I have done any less work than other weeks, I have just done twice the work in robotics. Seeing as the assignment is coming up, I will have to focus on data science a lot more this week. 

The only thing I have done is thought more about what I am going to do for the task, and have realised that talking about projected price will not work. Projected price of a player in NRL Fantasy are an AI made statisitc of where the player is expected to be valued in the coming weeks. My idea was to test whether this statistic was accurate. In that case, I would get to discuss error (which I did thouroughly in my physics assignment) and it would drastically narrow down the number of statistics I was looking at. The only problem with this is that there is no historcial projected price data available. I cannot record the data myself, as there is not enough time to record a significant amount of data so it is not practical to do this. I am not sure what else I will do, but it has to be something that has historical data.
