This week I received my draft feedback for my Robodebt task and completed the assignment. This was more difficult to do than the Shakey assignment, as it was much less polished, and there was less content. My original report was classwork, and contained around 600 words of informal research, on similar, but not identical research questions. This meant that a significant portion my time spent of the assignment was re-organizing and re-writing parts of the old report. My old report also did not have in-text referencing, so I had to find references for things that needed it. I gave myself very litle time to do all of this, and I am quite proud of the resulting report. I was able to format this report in LaTeX, for a nicer aesthetic. A picture of my title page is below.

My time during the weekend was split between the cyberquest competition (in which we are claiming 4th place), and my mechatronics report on Shakey the robot. Doing cyber-quest on Saturday took a lot of my energy away, and I procrastinated before getting into the meat of the mechatronics report. A form of productive procrastination was creating the referencing tool discussed in this week's other blog post. This meant I had to continue working on my mechatronics assignment into Sunday. I had not realised just how much editing I had to do before draft submission, and I only really ended up starting the Robodebt assignment at 5:00 pm Sunday. Although I worked until 11:00 pm, I did not have enough time to complete it. This meant staying home on Monday (today) was crucial, as I had not completed this blog post either. I am really not that proficient at time management, and especially when moving further into year 11, I should make a plan for individual days during the assessment period.
