  Hi, my name is Morgan Potter. I am a year 12 student currently studying at Burgmann Anglican School. I created this website as a weekly log of projects, challenges, ideas and self-reflection as my learning in IT continues through college. If you are interested in seeing any of the projects I have created you can check out my github, or read about them in this blog.
